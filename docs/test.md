# Testing 

This is a test document. 

## How about this? 

There, that's a sub-heading! 

What about _this_? Yep, **that** works! 

Heading 1 
========= 

Heading 2 
--------- 

How does that look? Perfect! 

> This is a blockquote, whatever that is 
> 
> Oh, I understand what that means now! 

> And this one is split off! 

> Can we put a heading in one of these? 
> 
> # We sure can! 

How do lists work? 
* Well 
* A 
* Bit 
* Like 
* This 

Or, if you prefer: 
+ You 
+ Can 
+ Do 
+ It 
+ Like 
+ This 

As for numbered lists, that goes: 
1. A 
2. Bit 
3. Like 
4. This 

Or you can have: 
* Multiple lines 

  In a single entry 

* Like that! 

  Or like this! 

## Now for a table 

Column A | Column B | Column C 
-------- | -------- | --------
How is this? | How is this? | How is this? 
Perfect! | Perfect! | Perfect!
